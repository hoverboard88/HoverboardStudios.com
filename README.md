=====================

*This README.md is still in-process.*

The following repo is the code for our website. At Hoverboard, we believe in sharing our knowledge with others.

## Minimum Viable Code ##

We used SVG's, didn't load jQuery, and used CriticalCSS to make the front-end as light-weight as possible.

## Wordpress Install ##

We didn't include Wordpress core in this repo.

## Gulp.js ##

The task-runner used is Gulp.js. To setup, run `npm install` in `wp-content/themes/hoverboard/`. Once setup, run `gulp` to compile or `gulp watch` to watch files while editing.

## SCSS ##

We used the [Hoverboard SCSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/hoverboard88/scss-boilerplate) as a starting point.
